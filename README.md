# Behavioral Design Patterns for Java

This repository will be introduced the structural GOF design patterns for Java. The patterns are:

- Chain of Responsibility - Create a chain, where each object decides whether to process or transmit to another element of the chain.  Usage Examples: When you need to execute different requests differently, whereas such possibilities are not known in advance.
- Command - Allows you to create commands to queued for transaction flow control and enable rollback. Usage Examples: When you need this object to be used to encapsulate all the information necessary to perform the action or trigger the event.
- Iterator - This pattern is used to get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner without any need to know its underlying representation. Usage Examples: When you need to browse a collection of objects using simple methods such as next and hasNext.
